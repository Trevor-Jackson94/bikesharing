# Overview Citi Bike Expansion Analysis
This analysis was to assess the value of a Citi Bike expansion based on NYC August 2019 data and trends seen in the NYC area of business.

## Results
The follow visualizations were developed and are included in the Tableau story to assess the Citi Bike expansion:

All of the following visuals are saved publicly to Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikeAugust2019DataStory/CitiBikeAugust2019DataStory?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Summary
These visualizations show that we have a high number of trips between the hours of 7-9am and 5-7pm. This likely associates the bikes trips with traveling to and from work. We also see that the highest usage of the bikes is done by males, specifically male subscribers during the week. In order to further assess the expansion of Citi Bike to other cities, I recommend creating visuals that show the average trip length in distance using the starting and ending stations. This will give us an idea on the average distance people are willing to travel via citi bikes and can help assess which cities the bikes would be widely used in. If further data was to be acquired it would be good to further assess whether the bikes are used for recreational purposes or if they're used for commuting to and from work. A visual that clear shows that data would be highly beneficial.
